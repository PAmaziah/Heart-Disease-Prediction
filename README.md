# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical features (like age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure), since Early diagnosis can drastically improve treatment outcomes.
This project predicts heart disease based on clinical features using machine learning (SVM, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) and is deployed using Streamlit.
